# (Brief enough) Intro to Databases... from a dev perspective

[Presentation](https://dgg.github.io/intro-to-databases/slides) and code samples for a shallow dive into databases geared towards not-so-experienced developers with light training on database systems or data modelling.

Each database sample code is hosted in a different branch:

* [CockroachDB](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/cockroach)
* [SQLite](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/sqlite)
* [REDIS](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/redis)
* [MongoDB](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/mongo)
* [InfluxDB](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/influx)
