# (Very brief) Intro to Databases

Code samples for a shallow dive into databases geared towards not-so-experienced developers without previous training on database systems or data modelling.

Each database sample code is hosted in a different branch:

* [SQLite](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/sqlite)
* [PostgreSQL](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/postgres)
* [REDIS](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/redis)
* [MongoDB](//github.com/dgg/intro-to-databases/tree/mongo)
